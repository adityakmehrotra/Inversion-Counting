# Inversion-Counting
Counting the number of inversions in an array.
- An `Inversion` is when a pair of numbers are out of their natural order.

## Inversion Counting (1 Array) Problem

### Problem Description
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of elements in the list.

### Sample Input
2<br>
5<br>
5 4 3 2 1<br>
4<br>
1 5 9 8

### Sample Output
10<br>
1

### Sample Input and Output Description
The sample input has two instances. The first instance has 5 elements and the second has 4. For eachinstance, your program should output the number of inversions on a separate line.

### Time Complexity
